                                            Rubi Vision is designed to provide maximum user privacy. After our latest update aimed at further enhancing user privacy, we now only collect the IP address of the machine running the software, exclusively for license verification and security purposes. No other personal or technical information is collected or stored.

                                            Our goal is to process all data locally, without transmitting information to external servers. This approach makes Rubi Vision the most suitable solution for confidential installations that require assurance that no recordings are "leaked". We are developing a version that works 100% offline, providing an additional layer of security for environments demanding the highest confidentiality.
